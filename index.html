                    <p id="para">Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam was born to a poor Tamil Muslim family. He lived with his family
                        in the temple city of Tamilnadu, Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was
                        an imam of a local mosque. At the same time, his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had
                        four brothers and one sister in his family, from which he was the youngest. Kalam's ancestors
                        were wealthy traders and landowners and had vast land and property tracts. But with time, their
                        business of ferrying pilgrims and trading groceries suffered huge losses due to the Pamban
                        Bridge's opening. As a result, Kalam's family had become inadequate and struggled hard to make a
                        living. At a tender age, Kalam had to sell newspapers to supplement his family income.</p>

                    <p id="para">Although Kalam had average grades in school, he was very hard working and had an
                        immense desire to learn. He spent a lot of time studying and had developed a particular interest
                        in mathematics. Kalam left Schwartz higher secondary school after completing his early education
                        and went to Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli. From Saint Joseph's College, he graduated in
                        physics in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering at Madras Institute
                        of Technology.</p>

                    <p id="para">Kalam joined as a scientist in the aeronautical development establishment of DRDO in
                        1960, after graduation. His career started with him designing a small hovercraft. However, he
                        was not convinced by his choice of a job at the DRDO. Kalam was transferred to ISRO in 1969,
                        where he was the project director of India's first satellite vehicle launch. The satellite
                        vehicle deployed the Rohini satellite successfully in near-Earth orbit in July 1980. Kalam

                        like Project Devil and Project Valiant, which aimed at developing ballistic missiles from the
                        successful SLV program's technology Kalam somehow convinced Indira Gandhi and sought secret
                        funds for these aerospace projects. His research and immense knowledge brought him and the
                        nation great laurels in the 1980s.</p>

                    <h2 id="h2">Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam's Biography -Kalam as the 11th President of India </h2>
                    <p id="para">Sir Kalam was entitled to be the 11th president of India. His term period of 25th July
                        2002 to 25th July 2007 was achieved by winning a presidential election in 2002 with a massive
                        margin of votes. National Democratic Alliances’ nominated him to be president and it was
                        supported by Samajwadi Party and National Congress Party. He was lovingly called as peoples’
                        president as he had done uncountable works for the welfare of the people and through the entire
                        country.


                        He was brave and courageous enough to take decisions and implement them no matter if that was
                        tough or sensitive or highly controversial. The “office of profit” is perhaps the hard Act that
                        he had to sign. The “office of profit”, according to the English Act of Settlement in 1701
                        explains that no single individual who has a professional set up under the royal family, who has
                        some kind of provision with or who is taking a pension from the prince has the right to work for
                        the of the “House of Commons”. This will allow the royal family to have zero influence on the
                        administrative conditions.</p>

                        country he remained immortal in the hearts of people. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was one such
